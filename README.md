# About the project
This project involved implementing the Backgammon game in Python using object-oriented programming. The program interacts with the user via a console interface, displaying appropriate messages. 
The game supports either 1 or 2 players. To allow a single player to play, the project includes a Bot class, which serves as a basic version of a 'computer player.' 
The project is well-documented, with detailed descriptions of each class and method provided in the repository. A UML diagram of the project is also included in the repository.
